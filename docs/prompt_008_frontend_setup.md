Let's work on the Frontend, this is the criteria for the Frontend: 

- For the frontend we want to use shadcn, we can implement the stone color scheme first and later we can implement the one from the design
- We want highly re-usable and deocupled components in the Frontend
- The routes for the frontend app are:
    - authorized and not-authorized (sign in, sign up and forgot password)
    - We need routes for the notes per categories, detail of the note (with update in the same), create of the note

Only take care of the creation of this files and routes, we can code components and UI later.
