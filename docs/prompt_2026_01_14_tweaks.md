Let's work on new tweaks: 

- Let's put a repeat your password at the sign up form and add a validation on that
- The dates on the notes can be more humanize, like: today, yesterday and after we can use the standard date for USA
- For Mobile, in the bottom of the drawer, I don't want the little dropdown menu, I want to flatten the options and the name of the user
- On the backend, every user should have 3 default categories: [Random Thoughts, School, Personal] with the colors, UI Attached.
- Also the New Note button looks kinda off as well, attached UI to review it
- Put validation on the backend and the frontend each category name should be unique 

Remember to save the prompt!
